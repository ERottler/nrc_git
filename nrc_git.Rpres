### Question:    
What is version control and why should I use it?
  
### Objectives:    
Understand the benefits of an automated version control system.    
Understand the basics of Git.

Distributed version control system
========================================================
  
### Version control system
System that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

### Distributed   
Means that there is no main server and all of the full history of the project is available once you clone the project


Why version control?
========================================================
  
### A long-lasting project has:
  
* many project stages and program versions
* a lot of changes on the way of getting there
* different people working on it

**A version control system traces all these steps (changes, versions, people) in your project history.**
  
Why verion control?
========================================================
  
* no longer hundrets of file versions with non-informative names
* documentation of projects for passing between persons / transferring it
* **common tool for transparent and sustainable work flow**
  * increase efficiency (for group work)

Why git?
========================================================
  
* it's free (open)
* non-linear development
* saves project history
* distributed (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket,...)
* cross platform
* very popular


Why git?
========================================================

What git can do
========================================================

* trace your work steps in a project
* regeneration of past work
* particularly useful in coding (pure ASCII or text files)
* merging work done independently

What git cannot do
========================================================

* you still have to document your code
* magically solve everything
* no backup system


Learning to talk git
========================================================

* initiate a git repository **[init]**
* whatching files (within this repo) **[add]**
* making a snapshot (commenting changes) **[commit]**
* parallel developing **[branch]**
* joining finished work steps **[merge]**
* moving around in time **[checkout]**
